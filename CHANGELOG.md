# Changelog

## v1.261028 AgentCore governance (2026-10-28)

- New tab "v1.261028 AgentCore": capability tables read from the binary diff, a runtime-bypass check and a gateway-caller-class check (pure engines in `server/src/agentcoreGov.js`, data in `agentcoreData.js`), `GET /api/agentcore`, `POST /api/agentcore/evaluate`, talk-track entry, 6 server tests and 3 web tests. Everything INFERRED; the real rules were not observed.

## v1.261027 scope gates (2026-10-28)

- New tab "v1.261027 scope gates": Cedar scope gate (Active vs candidate), PingFederate resource parameter trap, RequiredClaims scope tiers. Pure engines in `server/src/scopeGate.js`, data in `scopeData.js`, `GET /api/scope-gate`, `POST /api/scope-gate/evaluate` (scenario id plus optional own scope, bounded), a second diagram-studio/1 diagram (`scope-gate`), talk-track entry, 6 server tests and 4 web tests.

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)
- Step 1 (core, server and data), scaffolded from a sibling demo scaffold: pure `evaluateClaims` (nested dotted-path matching, flatten, bounded input), five claim-gate scenarios as `{{token}}` data in three vertical packs, AgentCore gateway posture mock (shape only), claim-gate diagram as diagram-studio/1 data, workspace-scoped evaluations and Reset, doctor, content pack, k8s manifests (not deployed). The web UI is step 2 (a placeholder page for now).
- Ports 5150-5199.
- Step 2: web UI (claim gate, posture, diagram, talk track, presenter mode), W3C traceparent on every mock hop, talk track as data, claim-gate diagram spacing.
